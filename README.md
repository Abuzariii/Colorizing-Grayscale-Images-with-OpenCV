Used Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) to colorize grayscale images.

Caffe is a deep learning framework built with RNNs and CNNs. Caffe 2 has been released and integrated into PyTorch library by Facebook since 2017. For official docs click [here.](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
